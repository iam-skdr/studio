# Aura Portfolio - V. Sri Krishna Deva Rayudu

This is a Next.js portfolio website built with Firebase Studio. It's designed to be a modern, interactive, and fully responsive showcase of skills, projects, and experience.

## Getting Started Locally

To get this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later.
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager): This comes bundled with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.** Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `package.json` file is located.

2.  **Install project dependencies.** Run the following command to install all the necessary libraries and packages defined in `package.json`:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the local server.** Once the installation is complete, you can start the Next.js development server by running:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **View your portfolio.** The server will start, typically on port 9002. Open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)

You should now see your portfolio running live on your local machine. Any changes you make to the source code (e.g., in the `src` directory) will automatically reload the page in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the `package.json` file, you will find several scripts:

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the application in development mode with hot-reloading.
*   `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of your application.
*   `npm run start`: Starts the production server (requires a build to be run first).
*   `npm run lint`: Runs the linter to check for code quality and style issues.
